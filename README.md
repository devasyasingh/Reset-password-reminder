Reset Password Reminder:
This is a dynamic program that sends an email reminder to change the password of any affected application before the expiry date. It uses a calendar that contains future expiry dates.

What do I need to do to make it work?

Replace the dates in the Excel calendar as per your requirements.
Replace the arguments in the workflow with your data.
Ensure that the Outlook application is installed.
